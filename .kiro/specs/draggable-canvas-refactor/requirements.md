# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current DraggableCanvas.tsx component is a monolithic file with over 3,000 lines of code that handles multiple responsibilities including canvas interactions, node rendering, GitHub API integration, and complex state management. This refactoring aims to break it down into modular, maintainable components that follow single responsibility principles and improve code readability, testability, and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the canvas functionality to be separated into logical modules, so that I can easily understand and maintain different aspects of the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality without breaking changes
2. WHEN a developer needs to modify node rendering THEN they SHALL be able to work in a dedicated node component file
3. WHEN a developer needs to modify canvas interactions THEN they SHALL be able to work in a dedicated canvas interaction module
4. WHEN a developer needs to modify GitHub API logic THEN they SHALL be able to work in a dedicated API service module

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation of concerns between UI components and business logic, so that I can test and modify each part independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN UI components SHALL be separated from business logic
2. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN GitHub API calls SHALL be abstracted into service modules
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN state management SHALL be centralized and predictable
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN utility functions SHALL be extracted into dedicated utility modules

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript interfaces and types to be organized in dedicated files, so that I can easily find and reuse type definitions across components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all TypeScript interfaces SHALL be extracted to dedicated type definition files
2. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN type definitions SHALL be logically grouped by domain (GitHub, Canvas, UI)
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN components SHALL import types from centralized type files
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN type definitions SHALL be reusable across multiple components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the node rendering logic to be modular, so that I can easily add new node types or modify existing node behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN node rendering SHALL be handled by dedicated components
2. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN different node types SHALL have their own component implementations
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN node styling and animations SHALL be separated from business logic
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN node interaction handlers SHALL be clearly defined and testable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want canvas interaction logic to be separated from rendering logic, so that I can modify pan, zoom, and drag behaviors independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN canvas pan/zoom logic SHALL be in dedicated hook or service
2. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN drag and drop logic SHALL be in dedicated modules
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN canvas coordinate transformations SHALL be centralized
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN interaction event handlers SHALL be clearly separated from rendering

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want GitHub API integration to be abstracted into service modules, so that I can easily modify API calls and add new GitHub features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN GitHub API calls SHALL be in dedicated service modules
2. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN API response processing SHALL be separated from UI components
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN API error handling SHALL be centralized and consistent
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN API rate limiting and caching SHALL be handled in service layer

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the component file structure to be intuitive and follow React best practices, so that new team members can quickly understand the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN components SHALL follow single responsibility principle
2. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN file names SHALL clearly indicate their purpose and contents
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN component hierarchy SHALL be logical and easy to navigate
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN each component file SHALL be under 200 lines of code
